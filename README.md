# End Shoes Monitor DiscordBot
**BOT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**


This DiscordBot works in the following way: once you have obtained the ID of the selected shoe (available online) and written on the chat where your DiscordBot is located, it will return you the link of the shoe on end.com (if it is contained in the following url: https://www.endclothing.com/eu/latest-products/latest-sneakers). 

If the shoe is not found it will keep looking for it until it finds it.
